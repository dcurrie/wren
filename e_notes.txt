Bugs:

The compiler generating unaligned data in tge instruction stream, ann the interpreter is
not paying attention to that. This works on x86 and Cortex-M3/4/7, but will fail on other
architectures, such as Cortex-M0, and ARM9.

Sandboxing:

Consider converting from addresses to offsets everywhere inside the_store
 -- the exception would be CCALL addresses

Alternatively, check all peek and poke operations to be within the_store;
what other operations would need this check?

Replace assert() with something that longjmps to reset the world

Extending:

Added CCALLs; would be nicer if they had their own Kind so they could be inlined;
this would require extending the kind field from 2 to 3 bits

To add funciton locals (e.g., "let xxx : yyy in ...") we'd need an additional field
in dictionary for the number of locals; it would be used along with arity to allocate
and drop stack cells on function call and tail call. The locals would live after the
arguments on the stack.
