Sandboxing:

Need to test jmpbuf code.

What other operations would need a bounds check?

Make poke operations optional? (setb setx setv) (See array syntax below.)

Extending:

Consider renaming GLOBAL_FETCH and GLOBAL_STORE to SETG and REFG for 
compatibility with REF/SET prims

Consider encoding string length after PUSH_STRING to avoid strlen()

To add function locals (e.g., "let xxx : yyy in ...") we'd need an additional field
for the number of locals; it would be used along with arity to allocate and drop 
stack cells on function call and tail call. The locals would live after the
arguments on the stack. 

Now that we've moved the arity to the first byte of the function body in code space,
the locals counts can go in that same byte.

Provide array syntax; bounds checking would work for all of 
the_store if the first word of the store was the store size. I.e., 0[index] = ...
The Forth CREATE word makes a new dict word that simply returns its code pointer. 
We could do the same for ARRAY, and store the size in the first couple bytes.
Otherwise we need a prim to return a value (and index) size to compute offsets.
Do we also need an align prim to optimize access time?


Readline support, e.g., https://github.com/Helius/microrl/network
(but microrl wants to prompt after every newline; need to be smarter)

# This isn't reliable. Probably need to hard wire this anyways
## Dangerous stuff here, don't play unless you understand!
#fun execute xt =

#   poke (find 'exec_helper'-1) (0x08 + sla (xt-c0) 16)
#
## Don't ever, ever call this!
#fun exec_helper = cr;cr
## End dangerous stuff

# Use execute on xt's of no argument functions.
# Example:
# fun test = puts 'Hello World';cr
# You can run test by executing it's xt.
# execute (find 'test')
